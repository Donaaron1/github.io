Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive slicers and a timeline for:
Month: Filter the data to view performance for a specific month or range of months.
Year: Filter the data to view performance by year.
Refund Request and Journey Status Correlation: Focus on how the refund request is determined by journey status (delayed, cancelled, on time).


**Key findings:** 
Overall performance metrics: Total Transaction, Total Revenue, Minimum Ticket Price, Maximum Ticket Price, and Average Ticket Price.
Most Popular Ticket Types: Analysed what ticket types are generating the most revenue and profit, aiding in optimization of price and availability to boost revenue and ticket sales.
